## Objective 
Create a clean and simple gallery-style website for a small (one person) custom chair upholstery company. I have started a next.js project; give me complete files that I can insert into that project. My description will be intentionally vague; do your best at designing the site.

## Details
Project uses typescript, tailwindcss, and next.js App router.

## Description
* I have some .png files - a logo, a picture of the business owner, and several photos of two different upholstery projects. Tell me where to place them in the code base you come up with.
* An "about" section with the picture of the business owner, a blurb about the her and her business, and contact info (email, Instagram)
* Gallery of the two upholstery projects. Should be able to handle an arbitrary number of images. Should be extensible so that new projects can be easily uploaded.
